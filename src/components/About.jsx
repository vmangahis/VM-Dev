            Enthusiastic in learning new stuffs especially in the field of programming. I'm a full stack web developer focusing mostly in languages like Javascript in the frontend 
            and Python in the backend while leaning towards in other languages and frameworks like C# and .NET Core. The concept of building ideas into reality and being able to have the 
            control over it through change is what drives my enthusiasm in programming overall.

            I love playing video games. Commonly first person shooters like Rainbow Six Siege, role-playing games like Monster Hunter Series. I also love PC Building which I usually do 
            whenever I needed to upgrade my workspace/gaming PC for various purposes.
